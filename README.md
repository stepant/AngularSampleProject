# AngularSampleProject
Simple Angular application from angular.io tutorial. Will be used as skeleton for playing around with Angular front.
https://angular.io/start

Things learned/refreshed:
<ul>
  <li>Angular framework</li>
  <li>Typescript</li>
  <li>Angular application configuration</li>
  <li>Angular application architecture and modules</li>
</ul>

To run this application:</br>
$>npm install </br>
$>ng serve </br>

Note that angular should be already isntalled. Time to time there is a need to run one of these (ng update @angular/cli @angular/core or ng update --all).
